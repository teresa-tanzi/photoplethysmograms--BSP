Project for the course "Biomedical Signal Processing", 2020

This project is the implementation of the anomaly detection algorithm presented in "An Algorithm for Real-Time Pulse Waveform Segmentation and Artifact Detection in Photoplethysmograms" [Fischer et al., 2016]

The repository contains the following files:
- bidmc.m, capobase.m, nonin.m: experiment executed on different datasets.
- analysis.m: empirical analysis and comparisons between the experiments.
- Xpod: directory containing the dataset acquired by me using an Xpod External OEM Pulse Oximeter.
- Teresa Tanzi - Presentazione BSP.pdf: pdf of the presentation I used to expose my project during the exam.
